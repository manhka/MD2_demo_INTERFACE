An interface is a completely "abstract class" that is used to group related methods with empty bodies
Like abstract classes, interfaces cannot be used to create objects
Interface methods do not have a body - the body is provided by the "implement" class
An interface cannot contain a constructor (as it cannot be used to create objects)
----------------------
Why And When To Use Interfaces?
1) To achieve security - hide certain details and only show the important details of an object (interface).

2) Java does not support "multiple inheritance" (a class can only inherit from one superclass). However, it can be achieved with interfaces, because the class can implement multiple interfaces.
 Note: To implement multiple interfaces, separate them with a comma (see example below).
